A [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) for my personal projects. Inspired by [Google](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext).

- `common` has utility code that I use in many projects.
- `fun` has small projects that I did for fun.
- `tools` has tools.
